Test suite for the processor. Here are some instructions.


    ---------------- USING THE TEST SUITE ----------------

Syntax is as follows. From the ECE350-Final-Project directory, run the following:

    . ./Processor/Test\ Files/Test\ Suite/runtests.txt

This will produce a vvp file corresponding to each test case. It's running a lot of tests, so it might take a minute. 


To check the output of each test case, run the following from the same directory:

    . ./Processor/Test\ Files/Test\ Suite/checktests.txt




    ---------------- EDITING THE TEST SUITE ----------------

To insert a new test, first make sure you've:
    - written your test_name.s file
    - assembled it, placing the test_name.mem file in /Memory Files
    - put a corresponding test_name_exp.txt file in /Verification Files

Now, add the following line to runtests.txt, where XX is 1 + the number of the last test case currently in the file:

    iverilog -o ./Processor/Test\ Files/Test\ Suite/VVP\ Files/procXX -c Modules.txt -s ProcWrapper_tb -P ProcWrapper_tb.FILE=\"test_name\"

And now to checktests.txt add the following line, again with the same XX:

    vvp ./Processor/Test\ Files/Test\ Suite/VVP\ Files/procXX -v

That's it! The new test case is now part of the test suite.
